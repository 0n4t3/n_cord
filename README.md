n_cord is a Nostr client with a UI inspired by Discord and functionality inspired by IRC. It has a chat style layout for posts, allows you to subscribe to "channels" (tags), and allows you to view all posts or only posts by those you follow. Adding a tag as a channel does NOT subscribe your account to that tag, so you can keep tabs on high volume tags without filling up your home feed. It's possible to sign in with either a key or a signing extension, and it can also function fine without signing in if you just want to see what the community is talking about on a specific tag.

It's probably not going to become your next main - there's no support for DMs, no notifications, and it supports a relatively limited number of NIPs. Instead, it works great when paired with a more standard client, letting you browse various tags and post basic messages from within a fairly minimalist web app. The web app itself is a single static HTML file, all functions being performed within your web browser itself, and I collect no data on anything that you do. If you wish to host it yourself it's as simple as downloading **index.html** and placing it on any server or host.
