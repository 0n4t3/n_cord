n_cord is a Nostr client with a UI inspired by Discord and functionality inspired by IRC. It has a chat style layout for posts, allows you to subscribe to "channels" (tags), and then filter between all posts or only posts by those you follow. Adding a tag as a channel does NOT subscribe your account to that tag, so you can keep tabs on high volume tags without filling up your home feed. It's possible to sign in with either a key or a signing extension, and it can also function fine without signing in if you just want to see what the community is talking about on a specific tag.

n_cord is probably not going to be your sole client, it's specifically focused on reading content from different tags & those you follow in a chat app fashion. It does support basic interactions like replies/quotes, reactions, and notifications - but has no support for things like DMs, reading replies to other people's posts, and has limited support for various NIPs.

The web app itself is entirely static, all functions being performed within your web browser itself, and I collect no data whatsoever. If you wish to host it yourself it's as simple as placing the contents of /src on any host.
