*This project is vibe coded, abanden all hope of stability ye who enter here.*

I decided to give vibe coding a try, this is what I wound up with. Honestly it's not too bad all things considered, it's a Nostr client that has a chatroom style layout, allowing you to subscribe to "chatrooms" (hashtags) or just view your following in a chatroom style layout. You can sign in with a Nostr signing extension like Nos2x - which is HIGHLY recommended for account security given aforementioned vibe coding.

The client itself is a single static HTML file tuned up with some javascript and CSS. The server doesn't do anything aside from serve the file, everything else happens within the browser itself, and it can be served as a static site through something like an Apache server or Github pages.

It could probably use a little more polish, which I do plan to implement, though long term support isn't fully garunteed as it was more so of an "I want to try vibe coding" then a "I want to make this service."
